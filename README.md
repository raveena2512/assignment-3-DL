# assignment-3-DL-RNN




for running the code refer to readme file.

This assignment is a work under the course cs6910 under the prof. Mithesh Kabhra from IIT Madras. This assigNment is an individual assignment. 

In this assignment, sequence to sequence model was build using RNN. a word in the native script and its corresponding transliteration in the Latin script (the way we type while chatting with our friends on WhatsApp etc). Given many such (xi,yi)i=1n(x_i, y_i)_{i=1}^n
pairs the goal is to train a model y=f^(x), which takes as input a romanized string (ghar) and produces the corresponding word in Devanagari (घर).
